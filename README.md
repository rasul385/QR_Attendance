# QR_Attendance
QR Attendance program done as a part of Entrepreneurship class, where I came up with idea to improve the attendance taking processes in university classes.

My idea was to use QR technology to log student names into the attendance sheet. It was supposed to speed up the attendance taking process and help prevent the students signing for absent friends. The whole project included program written in Python, business  and distribution plan.
